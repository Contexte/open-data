# List of national parties in the European Union

This list of 300+ European parties has been set up by the Paris-based news outlet [Contexte](http://www.contexte.com), a trusted source of independent reporting on French and EU policies. Initial version was prepared by Jean-Sébastien Lefebvre in Brussels, with the help of Yann Guégan in Paris.	

The data is primarly used to generate [Contexte’s dashboard on the 2019 European Parliament elections](https://www.contexte.com/article/pouvoirs/elections-europeennes-le-tableau-de-bord-de-contexte_93297.html).

About the columns:

* party primary and secondary political positions are a highly subjective matter, the value given is not set in stone but is the result of a editiorial call by Contexte’s journalists.
